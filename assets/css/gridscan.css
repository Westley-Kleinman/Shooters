/* If we want interaction, we might need pointer-events: auto on the canvas, 
   but that would block clicks on the page content. 
   For a background, usually we want it passive. 
   However, the effect has mouse interaction (looking). 
   We can attach the mouse listener to the window or body instead of the element. */
